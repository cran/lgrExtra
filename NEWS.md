# lgrExtra 0.0.5 (2021-02-23)

* Migration of experimental Appenders from [lgr](https://s-fleck.github.io/lgr/)
* `AppenderDbi`: The default setting for buffer_size has been changed to `0`. 
  This means every log event is written directly to the target database. If you
  want performance improvements, set the buffer to a nonzero value. 
* Removed `AppenderRjdbc`
* `AppenderGmail` is now compatible with gmailr 1.0.0
